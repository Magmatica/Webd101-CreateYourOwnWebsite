					<dd>Throughout history there has been some prominent events that have centered around the lgbt community.
					These can date back to the bc with the greeks up to today. A major event is the Stonewall riots that took place in Manhattan New York 
					in the United States. <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/gay-rights/the-stonewall-riots">Stonewall</a> Inn is the name of a gay bar within Manhattan. 
					It was during the 1960s that it was illegal to be LGBTQA within New York and the police were raiding places to arrest people for being members 
					of this community. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots">Stonewall</a> riot was during the year, 1969 where Stonewall inn was the target for a police
					raid. During this time, Stonewall was run by a mafia family who would pay off the police and open multiple different bars. The raid on Stonewall Inn is seen as the straw 
					that broke the camel's back as tensions between the police and the people were running high. This raid lead to the Stonewall riots as people of not only the community but 
					the town, were tired of the raids and the brutality of the police officers. The riots lead to the people fighting back and creating activist groups to fight 
					for the rights of the community. After a year of the riot, America had their first pride marches.</dd>
