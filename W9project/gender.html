					<dd>Gender is a social construct that we have learned as we grew. It started out as the idea that girls wear pink and boys wear blue but that is not the full understanding of gender.
					To begin you must have an idea about what we are talking about. When discussing gender, we are talking about gender identity which leads to the different categories we will discuss; cisgender,
					 transgender,non-binary and genderfluid. Cisgender is a term that is used for people who identify with the gender they were given at birth by the people around you. 
					Transgender is the other side of cisgender where a person does not identify with their assigned gender. Transgender is also used as an umbrella term at times for all people who do not identify as
					 cisgender. Non-binary means that a person identifies outside of the assigned binary. At birth we are assigned boy or girl, but for someone who is non-binary they are not one or the other. They 
					 are at times considered a third gender that is outside of the binary with pronouns such as they/them or xe/xem. This can also be seen as an umbrella term to cover anyone who does not fall into
					 the binary. Genderfluid is a term that is used for people who will identify as several different genders. This means that a person has a fluidity to their gender and can one day identify 
					 as one gender and use their pronouns, while the next day they could identify differently. An example of this would be Loki from Norse mythology where Loki has been reported to take on different
					 gender identities for a time. If you do not know someone's gender, the best method is to ask about their gender and pronouns. It is kinder to ask than it is to guess.</dd>
