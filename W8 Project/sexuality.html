					<dd>When a person uses terms like bisexual or asexual, you may be startled thinking that it all involves sexual intercourse. Sexuality started as a means of 
					telling people who you look at as a potential partner. Some people may use these terms to also stand as for romantic interest. Sexuality is a spectrum with numerous labels that people
					can choose to use. To start we need to look at the basics which would be bisexual/homosexual, asexual, and graysexual. Terms like bisexual and homosexual are uaws to show the type of partner a 
					person is interested in or more sexually compatible as we will see later on with the more indepth descriptions. Asexual is a term that people use when they do not tend to feel sexual attraction
					or are not interested in it. Graysexual is a term for the gray area people can be in between sexual and asexual where sometimes they can lean more towards one side than the other.</dd>
