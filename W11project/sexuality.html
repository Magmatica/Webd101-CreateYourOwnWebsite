				<dt class="category">What is Sexuality?</dt>
					<dd>When a person uses terms like bisexual or asexual, you may be startled thinking that it all involves sexual intercourse. Sexuality started as a means of 
					telling people who you look at as a potential partner, romantic or otherwise, it is not your <a href="gender.html">gender</a> identity. Some people may use these terms to also stand as for romantic interest. 
					Sexuality is a spectrum with numerous labels that people can choose to use. To start we need to look at the basics, 
					which would be heterosexual/homosexual,bisexual, asexual, and graysexual. <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/heterosexual" target="_blank">Heterosexual</a> means that a person is attracted to those of the 
					opposite gender identity whether that be women who like men, or men who like non-binary people, it means 
					that the person likes another gender. <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sex/what-is-homosexuality" target="_blank">Homosexual</a> is when a person is attracted to 
					those who share the same gender identity, like men who love men or genderfluid people who like genderfluid people. 
					<a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/article/understanding-bisexuality/" target="_blank">Bisexual</a> is a term that means 
					that a person is interested in more than one gender sometimes including their own gender.
					<a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/article/understanding-asexuality/" target="_blank">Asexual</a> is a term 
					that people use when they do not tend to feel sexual attraction
					or are not interested in it. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/graysexual#What-exactly-does-graysexual-mean?" target="_blank">Graysexual</a> is a term for the gray area people can be in between sexual 
					and asexual where sometimes they can lean more towards one side than the other.</dd>
